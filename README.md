# ChadGasm

ChadGasm is a 2D exploration platformer set amidst the rising of the Smitty race. When young Joseph Smith Jr. gets visited by Elohim and our Lord and Savior, even Jesus Christ, Chad is awoken with a deep and mysterious thirst for revenge. He follows Joseph through the perils of early Mormonism, conquering his most powerful lackies - the Angel Moroni and the Three Nephites of old - while enscribing upon the sealed portion of the Golden Plates. Now is the time that this holy scripture, comparable to the Book of Mormon, shall be released upon the world.

He travels through Palmyra to witness the confusion of the locals who disrespect our most beloved prophet. They murmur about young Joseph's ambitions to obtain celestial glory, leading Joseph heading west.

Chad then travels to Kirtland to see the church prospering. He witnesses the charisma of Joseph as he begins his tumultuous reign of polygamy. He pays his fair share of tithing to gain entry into the Kirtland Temple and defeat the Angel Moroni.

Through the swamps, Chad heads to Nauvoo to find the Temple still under construction. He pulls some serious 007 shit and obtains his Patriarchal Blessing from Joseph Sr. Upon exploration of the unfinished Temple, he is confronted, and ultimately destroys The Three Nephites.

While Joseph fled, he was captured by the Gentiles and imprisoned at Carthage Jail. In hot pursuit, Chad witnesses the intense hatred between the Smitties and the Gentiles, which culminates at the Haun's Mill Massacre. Governor Boggs has a tiff with Porter Rockwell after he orders the Smitty extermination.

Chad slaughters his way through the mighty mob surrounding the Carthage Jail. Joseph Jr. shoots at Chad as Hyrum and John Taylor take Chad on. Chad slaughters Hyrum, while Taylor is knocked out of the window after Chad's attacks are countered by the Pocketwatch. Chad slaughters Joseph in an intense battle as the mob outside is roaring with approval.

New No No: Brigham Young is prophet now, and Elohim has sent them west. Chad's loins explode in malicious fury, and he heads west. Travelling past the Pioneers through the bitter cold of winter, Chad loots and kills as he goes. He finds his way through the icy Rocky Mountains, fighting Porter Rockwell along the way.

Upon arrival at Great Salt Lake City, he is furious to encounter fucking gay letters everywhere, while English is still the spoken language.
