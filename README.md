# ChadGasm

ChadGasm is a 2D exploration platformer set amidst the rising of the Smitty race. When young Joseph Smith Jr. gets visited by Elohim and our Lord and Savior, even Jesus Christ, Chad is awoken with a deep and mysterious thirst for revenge. He follows Joseph through the perils of early Mormonism, conquering his most powerful lackies - the Angel Moroni and the Three Nephites of old - while enscribing upon the sealed portion of the Golden Plates. Now is the time that this holy scripture, comparable to the Book of Mormon, shall be released upon the world.

### Chapter I: A Marvelous Work and a Wonder

Chad awakes in a mysterious cave. He travels through the Sacred Grove to Palmyra and witnesses the confusion of the locals who disrespect our most beloved prophet. They murmur about young Joseph's ambitions to obtain celestial glory, leading Joseph heading west to avoid persecution.

### Chapter II: 

Chad then travels to Kirtland to see the church prospering. He witnesses the charisma of Joseph as he begins his tumultuous reign of polygamy. He pays his fair share of tithing, and endures an interview with the bishop to gain entry into the Kirtland Temple.

He encounters the Angel Moroni within the Holy of Holies. "I'm sorry Chad, but our prophet is in another Temple," he says before Chad disembowels him with the Sword of Laban.

### Chapter III: 

Through the swamps, Chad heads to Nauvoo to find the Temple still under construction. He pulls some serious 007 shit and obtains his Patriarchal Blessing from Joseph Sr. Upon exploration of the unfinished Temple, he is confronted, and ultimately destroys The Three Nephites.

### Chapter IV: Save Jesus Only

While Joseph fled, he was captured by the Gentiles and imprisoned at Carthage Jail. In hot pursuit, Chad witnesses the intense hatred between the Smitties and the Gentiles, which culminates at the Haun's Mill Massacre. Governor Boggs has a tiff with Porter Rockwell after he orders the Smitty extermination.

Chad slaughters his way through the mighty mob surrounding the Carthage Jail. Joseph Jr. shoots at Chad as Hyrum and John Taylor take Chad on. Chad slaughters Hyrum, while Taylor is knocked out of the window after Chad's attacks are countered by the Pocketwatch. Chad slaughters Joseph in an intense battle as the mob outside is roaring with approval.

### Chapter V: This is the Place

New No No: Brigham Young is prophet now, and Elohim has sent them west. Chad's loins explode in malicious fury, and he heads west. Travelling past the Pioneers through the bitter cold of winter, Chad loots and kills as he goes. He finds his way through the icy Rocky Mountains, fighting Porter Rockwell along the way.

Upon arrival at Great Salt Lake City, he is furious to encounter fucking gay letters everywhere, while English is still the spoken language. He travels south to assist in the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and on his way he stumbles upon a large cache of Nephite Gold in Salem, what will be called the Dream Mine. He travels north to delay the construction of the SLC Temple, and slaughters Brigham Young.

### Chapter VI: To the Moon and Back

Cain gives Chad a helpful tip: cause the second coming, and Chad can destroy the Godhead. Cain steals a Smitty's mission call to the Moon and sells it to Chad for a modest sum. Upon Chad's arrival, he slaughters Brigham Young, and using the power of the holy Melchizidek Priesthood, Chad is twinkled to the Moon.

He encounters the Moon Quakers upon his arrival. They have built a massive Temple to their God as they dwindle in iniquity. Exploring their Temple, Chad fights the Quaker's prophet in their 'Holy of Holies', causing the Moon's surface to rupture and erupt with volcanic blood. Chad is funnelled through the tower directly ahead of this room, seeing the Moon's surface reddoning as he hurtles back to the Earth.

### Chapter VII: The Latter Days

Salt Lake City circa 2017 is an evil place. With the moon blood-red, the stars falling from the sky, Cain getting the Priesthood, and the citizens of SLC engaging in disgusting debauchery, the Second Coming of Jesus Christ is nigh at hand indeed. The TBM Smitties are frantically hording their food and aggressively repenting of their iniquities.

He explores City Creek to find a secret passageway to the underground network of SLC. It leads into the Temple, where he must destroy the angels of heaven as Elohim throws everything he has at him. He slaughters Thomas S. Monson to arrive at the pinnacle of human existence - a showdown with Elohim himself. After he does a number on him, Elohim disappears into a spacetime vortex. Chad is pulled in, and is exerted to Jerusalem circa 600 B.C. to see Lehi prophesying of its destruction.

FIN.
